\usage{
bartRegrDiag(model, response, burnIn = 0, combineFact = FALSE, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a model created from either the BART, modelarts, or bartMachine package.}

\item{response}{The name of the response for the fit.}

\item{burnIn}{Trace plot will only show iterations above selected burn in value.}

\item{combineFact}{If a variable is a factor in a data frame, when building the BART model it is replaced with dummies.
Note that q dummies are created if q>2 and one dummy is created if q=2, where q is the number of levels of the factor.
If combineFact = TRUE, then the importance is calculated for the entire factor by aggregating the dummy variablesâ€™
inclusion proportions.}

\item{data}{A dataframe used to build the model.}
}
\value{
A selection of diagnostic plots
}
\description{
