\usage{
vimpPlot(
  trees,
  type = "prop",
  plotType = "barplot",
  metric = "median",
  combineFact = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{A data frame created by `extractTreeData` function.}

\item{type}{What value to return. Either the raw count 'count'
or the proportions 'prop' averaged over iterations.}

\item{plotType}{Which type of plot to return. Either a barplot 'barplot' with the
quantiles shown as a line, a point plot with the quantiles shown as a gradient 'point', or a
letter-value plot 'lvp'.}

\item{metric}{Whether to show the 'mean' or 'median' importance values. Note, this has
no effect when using plotType = 'lvp'.}

\item{combineFact}{If a variable is a factor in a data frame, when building the BART model it is replaced with dummies.
Note that q dummies are created if q>2 and one dummy is created if q=2, where q is the number of levels of the factor.
If combineFact = TRUE, then the importance is calculated for the entire factor by aggregating the dummy variablesâ€™
inclusion proportions.}
}
\value{
A plot of variable importance.
}
\description{
Plot the variable importance for a BART model with the 25% and 75%
quantile.
