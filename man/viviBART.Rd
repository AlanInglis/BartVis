\usage{
viviBart(treeData, combineFact = FALSE, out = "vivi")
}
\arguments{
\item{treeData}{A data frame created by extractTreeData function.}

\item{combineFact}{If a variable is a factor in a data frame, when building the BART model it is replaced with dummies.
Note that q dummies are created if q>2 and one dummy is created if q=2, where q is the number of levels of the factor.
If combineFact = TRUE, then both the importance and interactions are calculated for the entire factor by aggregating the dummy variablesâ€™
inclusion proportions.}

\item{out}{Choose to either output just the variable importance ('vimp'),
the variable interaction ('vint'), or both ('vivi') (default).}
}
\value{
A list of dataframes of VIVI summaries.
}
\description{
Returns a list containing a dataframe of variable importance summaries
and a dataframe of variable interaction summaries.
