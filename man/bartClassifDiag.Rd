\usage{
bartClassifDiag(
  model,
  data,
  response,
  threshold = "Youden",
  pNorm = FALSE,
  showInterval = TRUE,
  combineFact = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a model created from either the BART, dbarts, or bartMachine package.}

\item{data}{A dataframe}

\item{response}{The name of the response for the fit.}

\item{threshold}{A dashed line on some plots to indicate a chosen threshold value.
by default the Youden index is shown.}

\item{pNorm}{apply pnorm to the y-hat data}

\item{showInterval}{LOGICAL if TRUE then show 5\% and 95\% quantile intervals.}

\item{combineFact}{If a variable is a factor in a data frame, when building the BART model it is replaced with dummies.
Note that q dummies are created if q>2 and one dummy is created if q=2, where q is the number of levels of the factor.
If combineFact = TRUE, then the importance is calculated for the entire factor by aggregating the dummy variablesâ€™
inclusion proportions.}
