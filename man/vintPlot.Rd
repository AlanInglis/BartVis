\usage{
vintPlot(treeData, combineFact = FALSE, plotType = "barplot", top = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{treeData}{A data frame created by treeData function.}

\item{combineFact}{If a variable is a factor in a data frame, when building the BART model it is replaced with dummies.
Note that q dummies are created if q>2 and one dummy is created if q=2, where q is the number of levels of the factor.
If combineFact = TRUE, then the importance is calculated for the entire factor by aggregating the dummy variablesâ€™
inclusion proportions.}

\item{plotType}{Which type of plot to return. Either a barplot 'barplot' with the
quantiles shown as a line, a point plot with the quantiles shown as a gradient 'point', or a
letter-value plot 'lvp'.}

\item{top}{Display only the top X metrics (does not apply to the letter-value plot).}
}
\value{
A plot of variable importance.
}
\description{
Plot the pair-wise variable interactions inclusion porportions
for a BART model with the 25% and 75% quantile.
