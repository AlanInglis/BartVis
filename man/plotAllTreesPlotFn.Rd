\arguments{
\item{treeList}{A list of trees created by treeList function.}

\item{sampleSize}{Sample the tree list.}

\item{sizeNode}{Whether to size node width by the number of observations that fall into that node.}

\item{pal}{A palette to colour the terminal nodes.}

\item{fillBy}{Which parameter to colour the terminal nodes. Either 'response' or 'mu'.}

\item{combineFact}{If a variable is a factor in a data frame, when building the BART model it is replaced with dummies.
Note that q dummies are created if q>2 and one dummy is created if q=2, where q is the number of levels of the factor.
If combineFact = TRUE, then the dummy factors are combined into their original factor.}

\item{name}{Variable names}
}
\value{
A list containing vectors of the indices of observations from leaf nodes.
}
\description{
This function is used to creat the plots.
